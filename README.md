## About
This web app was created with the Caribbean community in mind. While travelling around Europe during a semester abroad I felt homesick, out of place and lost at some points. Unable to find places that reminded me of home, I felt like I wasn't the only one, and wished there was a central place that had the information I needed to locate a grocery store or another Caribbean establishment that was close to where I was staying. I hope that this project can help others during their journies.
